# Dream recorder
A device and software that reads people's dreams and records them

## what?

How many times you have had a beautiful dream that made you happy, but you wake up and puff - it's all gone. Would't you like to be able to see it all again?

Or a dream that was like a movie. An exciting action movie, or a beautiful romance. Wouldn't it be great to record it and later show to your friends?

It would be great to have a device that can do it, right?
